# Feature-Selection
Dealing with Different Feature selection techniques 

Feature selection in data analytics is used to identify the relevent features that contribute to our prediction and removing the features which are irrelevant to the prediction. 

3 Main reasons benifits are

* Improved Accuracy : As we are removing irrelevant features.
* Reduced Training Time: Fewer Data means less time to run the algorithm.
* Reduced Overfitting: Less redundant data is already removed, so less decisions based on noise.

3 Main Feature selection Techniques

* Univariate Selection: Using a Statistical method called 'SelectKbest' and 'Chi2' function.
* Feature Importance: Using inbuilt class called 'Feature Importance' in Tree based classifier(ExtraTreesClassifier).
* Correlation Matrix with Heatmap.
